CompTIA Network+ Exercise 2
Overview
Over the past four weeks you’ve covered a lot of material! You’re well on your way to becoming a Networking Expert. To recap the content so far, you have:
⦁	Received a concise overview of the Network content and the objectives tested
⦁	Received hand on experience thru labs.
⦁	Received demos as provided by the instructor
This project is one of seven projects you will complete through the boot-camp. These projects both provide you with hands-on experience and can serve as the start of your cloud experience!
For this project, you are going to be able to explain how to identify and design the proper components to build a home network that is robust and secure. 
The overall goal is to ensure you understand the complexities of designing a secure home network.
 
Overall Technical Workflow
⦁	Identify your components (⦁	Appendix A)
⦁	Draw out your diagram identify the network architecture, proper subnetting and security components such as firewalls, proxies and routers. 
⦁	Wireless Network Security - Describe how to secure your network
⦁	Testing  Network Ports- Describe how to test your network connection and ports.
⦁	Click the link here to find out ⦁	Appendix B, ⦁	Appendix C, and ⦁	Appendix D 
 
Concepts Covered
⦁	Validate Components
⦁	Determine Network(CIDR) range and subnets
⦁	Design a secure home network
⦁	Describe how to setup the Cable Modem
⦁	Identify Wireless setup terminology
⦁	Describe how to Setup the Wireless Router
⦁	Identify how to secure your Wireless Router
⦁	Describe how to validate and test your connections.

Requirements
Your project will be evaluated on how well it meets the following criteria:
⦁	How you identify components
⦁	How you describe the steps to setup network
⦁	How you plan your networking configuration
⦁	How you diagram your network and justify configuration
⦁	How you would test IP addresses, validates if ports are open and other security requirements.

Submission
When you have completed the project, email your instructor following deliverables:
 
Return exercise document completed to confirm project completion **
Return to instructor diagram of your components and justification of network topology.**

**Instructor Victor Note**

Please submit 1 word document with screenshots or images of your diagrams in it. Describe the different components along with the reasoning associated with the decisions taken.
